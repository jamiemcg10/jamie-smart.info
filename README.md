MioCrew is a full stack app designed to help people coordinate group trip logistics. Users can create trips, add the crew who's going, create a schedule, track expenses, and more.

The front end was built with React and incorporates Next.js for routing. Material UI, HeroUI, and Tailwind CSS are used for components and styling. The back end was built with Python and FastAPI. A SQLite database and WebSockets are used to provide and synchronize the data layer.
