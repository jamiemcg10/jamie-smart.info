Hi! I'm going to walk you through My Virtual Cookbook. An app for organizing recipes. First, I'm going to log in to my account.

0:00:11.620 --> 0:00:16.500
I want to add a new recipe for banana bread. I don't have a bread chapter yet.

0:00:16.510 --> 0:00:21.220
I could add one using the Add Chapter button, but instead I'll create it when I add the recipe.

0:00:31.910 --> 0:00:35.710
This is actually a dessert, so I'll move it to the desserts chapter.

0:00:36.510 --> 0:00:39.440
This chapter is empty now, so I don't need it anymore.

0:00:41.690 --> 0:00:45.550
This is a really good dessert, so I want to move it to the top of the chapter.

0:00:47.640 --> 0:00:52.300
You know, I always forget to add extra chocolate chips. I'll make a note about that here.

0:00:56.370 --> 0:01:00.910
And I make desserts a lot, so I'll move that chapter to the top of the cookbook.

0:01:03.680 --> 0:01:08.670
Ah, I want to find that banana bread recipe again. I think I gave it the wrong name. 

0:01:08.671 --> 0:01:14.670
There's a menu here where I can edit the recipe. The menu is also on the main page, but I'll just edit it here.

0:01:21.810 --> 0:01:30.400
As you can see, My Virtual Cookbook makes it easy to organize your recipes and keep notes for them. Give it a try! I'm off to make this banana bread.
